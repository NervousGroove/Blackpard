Blackpard will be installed in the folder you select in the installer, you must select the folder in which the project is located, if you select a directory that does not exist, it will be created. One of the files that are installed, is the "package.spike" file, in it there is all the configuration of your project, such as the app name, author name and the main file. The main file means the main ".bpd" file (Blackpard related file) of your project that will be executed when running the executable.

## 🚀 Documentation

## ⚡ How to create variables
Unlike other known languages, in Blackpard you can define variables using only the keyword "vlu" (short for "value"). It is quite simple to create variables in our language, just use the keyword, then the variable name and then the value. Here is an example:
```python
vlu("HelloVar", "Hello World")
```
In this example, a variable called "HelloVar" was created with the value "Hello Word". Always, the first word in quotes means the name of the variable and the second word in quotes, means the value.

## ⚡ How to create functions
To create functions in Blackpard is quick and easy. You must use the keyword "action". For example:
```python
action Test() {
print("Hello")
}
```

## ⚡ Creating constant variables (Static)
In most languages, there are constant variables. They have a fixed value and do not change. But we find this name a bit meaningless and we don't think the name "constant" defines a variable that doesn't change its value, so we changed the name to "static". This is why in Blackpard constant variables are created with the keyword "sta" (short for "static"). Here is an example:
```python
sta("HelloVar", "Hello World")
```

## ⚡ Language Patterns
To make it easier and leave a striking syntax, which you will realize by the time you are part of the Blackpard language, our language has patterns. For example, all commands start with the keyword BDP (Short for Blackpard) and, the name of every command is referring to its own purpose.

## ⚡ Playing audios
To play audios in Blackpard you only need a little code, which takes the necessary information to play a certain audio. You should just call the function "BPDPlayAudio" and set the audio directory. For example:
```python
BPDPlayAudio()
vlu("audioDirectory", "audio.mp3")
vlu("audioName", "audioTest")
```

## ⚡ How to stop audios
In the previous topic you learned how to play audio, now let's do it the other way around. Notice that in the example code, you define the name of the audio, and this serves a purpose. With the name of the audio you can stop that specific audio, for example:
```python
BDPStopAudio()
vlu("stopThis", "audioTest")
```

## ⚡ Creating comments
You can create a code, and after days or months, come back to edit that code, or another common situation, you create a code for other people to edit together. To make it easier for you or others to understand your code, most languages provide comments. On the web (in social networks) we use the "@" to make quotes, so we thought that this character would make a lot more sense than the characters chosen to create comments in other languages. In Blackpard you can create comments using the "@" character. Here is an example:
```text
@ Hello World
```

## ⚡ Manipulating the GUI
You can add elements to your app, after all everything is made up of elements. You can add inputs, buttons, images, text and more!
Here is an example:
```python
@ A button
BPDCreateButton()
mybtn.prop(text = "Click Me", class = "test", event = "func", group = "main")
@ Creating an input
BPDCreateInput()
myinput.prop(text = "Type anything", class = "test", group = "main")
@ Creating Texts
BPDCreateText()
mytext.prop(text = "Hello World", class = "test", group = "main")
```

## ⚡ Editing Styles
Note that when creating elements, you can add the "class" property. This property binds a certain object as part of the style. For example, in the previous topic, the example shows a button with the "class" set to "test". For editing styles, Blackpard uses the "uilang" language, which is very similar to CSS.

## ⚡ Sending mail
In other languages, to send automated emails you need libraries, in Blackpard, this is a native tool. It's simple, just call the "BPDSendEmail" function and set the destination, subject and content. Here is an example:
```python
BPDSendEmail()
myemail.prop()
```

## ⚡ Setting the Window Title
To customize your window title is easy, follow the example:
```python
BPDSetWindowTitle()
vlu("windowTitle", "Test")
```

## ⚡ Manipulating Files
Manipulating files doesn't have to be difficult, so Blackpard simplifies this process. Here's an example:
```python
@ How to Open Files
BPDOpenFile()
vlu("fileDir", "Test.exe")
How to Read Files
BPDReadFile()
myfile.read(setContentTo = "myVar", fileDir = "main.txt")
```

## ⚡ Predefined Data
Predefined data is nothing more than privileged information about the user's hardware and software, such as: Date and Time, Hardware IDs (CPU and GPU), Average Connection Speed, and more. You can get this information easily, from variables that are updated every second, making data efficiently available, See:

## ⚡ Conditions
Conditions are everything. Your app revolves around conditions, they are simple but can help you a lot. In Blackpard, you can create the famous conditions, using "is" and "else". Here are some examples:
```python
is (fileDir = "test.exe") {
print("Is test.exe")
}

else {
print("is another")
}
```
You can also check if it is more or less, for example:
```python
is (num1 > 5) {
print("+ 5")
}

else {
print("- 5")
}
```
Or another example:
```python
is (num1 < 5) {
print("- 5")
}

else {
print("+ 5")
}
```

## ⚡ Math
Well fortunately (or unfortunately for many), math is everywhere, including programming. At Blackpard, everything is easy, including math. Here are examples:
```python
@ Addition
BPDMath()
add.math(5 + 5)
Division
BPDMath()
split.math(100 / 10)
@ Subtraction
sub.math(10 - 5)
@ Multiplication
multi.math(5 * 5)
```

## ⚡ Opening URLs
You can open URLs in the user's default browser. See:
```python
BPDOpenURL()
vlu("setURL", "https://myurl.com")
```
